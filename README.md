This is the capstone project for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program.

## Topic/Inspiration

Using Spark to Predict Churn with Insight Data Science 
(If you decide to complete this project, you can find a series of Spark lessons in the extra-curricular portion of your classroom, as well as a Spark Project Overview and Spark Project Workspace later in this Capstone Project module.)

## Steps taken

## File/directory tree

## TO DO: Instructions from Udacity:

Student must have a Github repository of their project. The repository must have a README.md file that communicates the libraries used, the motivation for the project, the files in the repository with a small description of each, a summary of the results of the analysis, and necessary acknowledgements. If the student submits a web app rather than a blog post, then the Project Definition, Analysis, and Conclusion should be included in the README file, or in their Jupyter Notebook. Students should not use another student's code to complete the project, but they may use other references on the web including StackOverflow and Kaggle to complete the project.
